# Appointment Management System

**The idea is to build an appointment management system that helps in managing customers, contacts, appointments, visits, notes, billing, and services.**

## Features:
* The system shall manage users, roles, and permissions. Each user will be able to log in to the system with a username and password and access the pages based on the permissions he/she has.

* The system shall manage customers. Each customer should have a record in the system so we can track his/her appointments and visits.

* The system shall manage contacts so the center can communicate with them. All customers will exist as contacts. We also added options to add companies, providers â€¦etc.

* The system shall manage appointments. Users should be able to add new appointments using the calendar. The calendar will support multiple views like day, week, and month.

* The system shall allow customers to book appointments.

* The system shall support multiple appointment reservations.

* When the user arrives at the center/clinic, the appointment will be converted to a visit and the user can add notes on each visit.

* The system shall manage the services. The user can add the services with prices so we can use them later in billing.

* The user should be able to add an invoice for each visit.

* The system should be able to generate the needed reports.

## Other tools used in the project:
We also used Jenkin CI to reliably build, and test our software, SonarQube to improve the quality of our code and to refactor it properly, Jacoco for generating reports about the code coverage. We also applied JUnit Testing for the project using Cucumber, Gherkins.
